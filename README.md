        monthly_expenses: float,
        current_savings: float,
        emergency_fund_minimum: float
    ) -> dict:
        """
        Deterministic calculation ensuring mathematical accuracy
        """
        available_monthly = monthly_income - monthly_expenses
        
        # Ensure emergency fund is maintained
        if current_savings < emergency_fund_minimum:
            months_to_emergency = (
                (emergency_fund_minimum - current_savings) / 
                available_monthly
            )
            remaining_monthly = available_monthly
        else:
            months_to_emergency = 0
            remaining_monthly = available_monthly
            
        months_to_target = (
            target_amount / remaining_monthly
        ) + months_to_emergency
        
        return {
            "monthly_savings": remaining_monthly,
            "total_months": int(months_to_target),
            "completion_date": calculate_date(months_to_target),
